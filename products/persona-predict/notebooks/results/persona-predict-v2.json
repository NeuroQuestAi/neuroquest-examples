I'm open to learning and trying new things, which is helping me adapt to everything that comes my way - from new systems to unexpected challenges. Each day feels like an opportunity to broaden my skills, and I’ve realized that this openness to experience is making my work feel more engaging and creative. Being in a dynamic work environment is energizing. I’d describe myself as someone who's fairly outgoing, and I’ve enjoyed connecting with my colleagues and building new relationships. These interactions not only make the day more enjoyable but also make me feel part of a bigger team effort. Of course, I won’t lie - there are moments when I feel a little nervous or uncertain, especially when I’m facing something completely unfamiliar. It can be a bit overwhelming at times, and I sometimes worry about making mistakes. But I’m learning to handle these moments by reminding myself that it’s all part of growth. I try not to let those feelings of doubt linger too long, focusing instead on the positives. Being detail-oriented and organized helps me keep on top of things, even when there's a lot going on. I’m committed to doing my best, and I find a sense of satisfaction in completing my tasks responsibly and efficiently. I guess this conscientious side is helping me build trust and reliability within the team. Finally, I’m grateful to be in a place where people are genuinely supportive. Everyone seems to value teamwork and respect, and that aligns with my own desire to work in harmony with others. These first steps in my career feel meaningful, and I’m excited to see where this journey will take me.", "word_count": 288, "detected_language": "en-us"}, "personalities": [{"openness": {"name": "Openness", "acronym": "O", "result": 67.14336942276817, "score": "high", "confidence": 98.2726221320349, "traits": [{"trait": 1, "name": "Imagination", "result": 65.55242069721896, "score": "high", "confidence": 98.21748834096253}, {"trait": 2, "name": "Artistic Interests", "result": 69.67639125501738, "score": "high", "confidence": 98.31411818133155}, {"trait": 3, "name": "Emotionality", "result": 64.6513758181128, "score": "high", "confidence": 98.20816024845988}, {"trait": 4, "name": "Adventurousness", "result": 67.80084754242598, "score": "high", "confidence": 98.30569226913131}, {"trait": 5, "name": "Intellect", "result": 64.97772607952314, "score": "high", "confidence": 98.23600640145548}, {"trait": 6, "name": "Liberalism", "result": 70.20145514431081, "score": "high", "confidence": 98.35426735086865}]}}, {"conscientiousness": {"name": "Conscientiousness", "acronym": "C", "result": 48.75688737057772, "score": "average", "confidence": 97.55412759616735, "traits": [{"trait": 1, "name": "Self-Efficacy", "result": 48.88367260477205, "score": "average", "confidence": 97.68771264286433}, {"trait": 2, "name": "Orderliness", "result": 50.42728808278259, "score": "average", "confidence": 97.73067863787989}, {"trait": 3, "name": "Dutifulness", "result": 47.651391653172695, "score": "average", "confidence": 97.41642948091774}, {"trait": 4, "name": "Achievement-Striving", "result": 48.06398627808579, "score": "average", "confidence": 97.60001485767592}, {"trait": 5, "name": "Self-Discipline", "result": 48.639594833832454, "score": "average", "confidence": 97.37120095148552}, {"trait": 6, "name": "Cautiousness", "result": 48.87539077082077, "score": "average", "confidence": 97.51872900618072}]}}, {"extraversion": {"name": "Extraversion", "acronym": "E", "result": 85.91171517187894, "score": "high", "confidence": 98.73935828027804, "traits": [{"trait": 1, "name": "Friendliness", "result": 85.71598899290142, "score": "high", "confidence": 98.73594726079656}, {"trait": 2, "name": "Gregariousness", "result": 86.50899248184467, "score": "high", "confidence": 98.77050305097576}, {"trait": 3, "name": "Assertiveness", "result": 83.24309346268203, "score": "high", "confidence": 98.67991252600396}, {"trait": 4, "name": "Activity Level", "result": 86.13630537845029, "score": "high", "confidence": 98.70425808649973}, {"trait": 5, "name": "Excitement Seeking", "result": 86.70829204904906, "score": "high", "confidence": 98.7724608595977}, {"trait": 6, "name": "Cheerfulness", "result": 87.15761866634611, "score": "high", "confidence": 98.77306789779448}]}}, {"agreeableness": {"name": "Agreeableness", "acronym": "A", "result": 42.3877584585016, "score": "low", "confidence": 96.14601020944654, "traits": [{"trait": 1, "name": "Trust", "result": 47.11976415684818, "score": "average", "confidence": 97.47370082335824}, {"trait": 2, "name": "Morality", "result": 40.19746112367908, "score": "low", "confidence": 94.66695086981741}, {"trait": 3, "name": "Altruism", "result": 39.725919770340575, "score": "low", "confidence": 94.55228413305682}, {"trait": 4, "name": "Cooperation", "result": 42.488173121509476, "score": "low", "confidence": 96.79567466448998}, {"trait": 5, "name": "Modesty", "result": 43.41463082289796, "score": "low", "confidence": 96.61000987267795}, {"trait": 6, "name": "Sympathy", "result": 41.38060175573432, "score": "low", "confidence": 96.77744089327884}]}}, {"neuroticism": {"name": "Neuroticism", "acronym": "N", "result": 43.89840224340704, "score": "low", "confidence": 97.51618856271249, "traits": [{"trait": 1, "name": "Anxiety", "result": 47.68747957233561, "score": "average", "confidence": 97.81872235723206}, {"trait": 2, "name": "Anger", "result": 43.14858902304794, "score": "low", "confidence": 97.35379587557274}, {"trait": 3, "name": "Depression", "result": 39.74993853558701, "score": "low", "confidence": 97.34832988876431}, {"trait": 4, "name": "Self-Consciousness", "result": 46.48347663591312, "score": "average", "confidence": 97.73290643456784}, {"trait": 5, "name": "Immoderation", "result": 41.43858591654961, "score": "low", "confidence": 97.34377472142742}, {"trait": 6, "name": "Vulnerability", "result": 44.88234377700894, "score": "low", "confidence": 97.49960209871047}]}}], "warnings": ["For a more accurate analysis, it is better for the text to contain more words than 288."]}}, "information": {"processed_by": "srv-1", "processing_time": 2.8711288479998984}, "owner": {"user_id": "MJumNgU0iud90UsEtohNeh6g0ju1", "email": "ederbsd@gmail.com"}, "provider": {"name": "NeuroQuest AI", "product": "Persona-Predict", "api": {"version": "v2.0.0"}, "model": {"name": "Claudia", "theory": "Big 5 Personality Traits", "version": "v2.0.0"}, "date": "2024-11-08 02:26:32 UTC"}}}
