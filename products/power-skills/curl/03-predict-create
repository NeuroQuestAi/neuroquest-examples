ESSAY="Generative Artificial Intelligence (or GenAI) is now being regarded as the most significant technological revolution since the advent of the internet. Tools such as Chat GPT and Bard have effectively demonstrated the reasons behind this assertion. According to a recent report, the implementation of GenAI across various industrial sectors has the potential to mobilize up to U$4.4 trillion annually, equivalent to approximately R$22 trillion. It is anticipated that 75% of this figure will be generated by four key areas: marketing & sales, research & development, customer relations, and software engineering. The sectors expected to undergo the most substantial impact from the adoption of GenAI are identified as the banking sector, with an estimated annual impact ranging from R$970 billion to R$1.6 trillion, and the retail sector, where this impact may reach values between R$1.9 trillion and R$3.2 trillion annually. Additionally, the text addresses potential effects that this new technology will have on the workforce, projecting a 60% to 70% impact on professionals' time. This will not only affect team productivity but will also directly influence companies' organizational structures. The text emphasizes the opportunity to learn directly from early adopters of this technology at the C-Summit, scheduled to take place on November 28, 29, and 30. This event is entirely online and free of charge. If you know someone interested in this knowledge, we encourage you to share this post."
